# Christmas baking 2025

We're making a Christmas trio: mandarin cake with orange blossom frosting,
banana bread with mascarpone cream (or whipped cinnamon ganache?), and
invisible cake.

## Mandarin cake

From Gartine's book.
Probably need to double the recipe to fill one cake mold.

### Cake

* 225 g carrots
* 160 ml sunflower oil
* 2 eggs
* 195 g light brown sugar
* 165 g mandarins
* 70 g almonds
* 250 g self-rising flour (find substitute)
* 1 thick vanilla stick
* 2 tsp cloves

Heat oven to 200°C.
Grease the cupcake liners with the extra tablespoon of sunflower oil and line the bottoms with baking paper.

Peel and coarsely grate the carrots.
Beat the oil, eggs, and caster sugar at high speed with a mixer until thick and creamy.
In a food processor, purée the mandarins (with their skins) with the almonds and carrots.
Add the flour, vanilla seeds, and ground cloves and mix briefly.
While still beating, gradually fold the mandarin-carrot mixture into the egg batter.
Beat until well combined, but do not overbeat.

Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners.
Bake the cupcakes in the center of the oven for 20 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the liners on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from their pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.

### Frosting

* 140 g room-temperature butter
* 80 g powdered sugar
* 1 tsp orange blossom water
* 100 g cream cheese
* 2 tbsp honey

Make the frosting by thoroughly beating all the ingredients together with a mixer.
Refrigerate until the cupcakes are completely cooled.
Spread the frosting on top of the cupcakes.
