# Christmas baking 2025

We're making a Christmas trio: mandarin cake with orange blossom frosting,
banana bread with mascarpone cream (or whipped cinnamon ganache?), and
invisible cake.

## Mandarin cake

From Gartine's book.

### Cake

Makes 10-12 small cakes.

* 225 g carrots
* 160 ml sunflower oil
* 2 eggs
* 195 g light brown sugar
* 165 g mandarins
* 70 g almonds
* 250 g self-rising flour (find substitute)
* 1 thick vanilla stick
* 2 tsp cloves

Heat oven to 200°C.
Grease the cupcake liners with the extra tablespoon of sunflower oil and line the bottoms with baking paper.

Peel and coarsely grate the carrots.
Beat the oil, eggs, and caster sugar at high speed with a mixer until thick and creamy.
In a food processor, purée the mandarins (with their skins) with the almonds and carrots.
Add the flour, vanilla seeds, and ground cloves and mix briefly.
While still beating, gradually fold the mandarin-carrot mixture into the egg batter.
Beat until well combined, but do not overbeat.

Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners.
Bake the cupcakes in the center of the oven for 30 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the liners on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from their pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.

### Frosting

* 140 g room-temperature butter
* 80 g powdered sugar
* 1 tsp orange blossom water
* 100 g cream cheese
* 2 tbsp honey

Make the frosting by thoroughly beating all the ingredients together with a mixer.
Refrigerate until the cupcakes are completely cooled.
Spread the frosting on top of the cupcakes.

[Test kitchen 2](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/17178-gateau-invisible-with-brown-sugar-cinnamon-whipped-cream).

Makes 8 small cakes.

* 132 g granulated sugar
* 1 vanilla bean
* 2 large eggs
* 70 g all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon table salt
* 1 kg pink lady/Fuji/golden delicious, peeled
* 2 tsp apple jelly, melted

I don't have apple jelly so I make a syrup from the apple peels and cores by reducing a 50/50 mix of water and sugar with them in it, then strain.

Whisk sugar, vanilla and eggs until smooth.
Whish in flour, baking powder, and salt until smooth.
Slice apples with mandolin; 5 slices should measure 1.2 cm (setting 3 on mandolin).
Reserve slices for the top, add all others to batter and fold to coat.
Set aside for 15 minutes.

Heat oven to 170°C.
Grease mold with vegetable spray and line with baking paper.
Fill mold with apples, lay reserved apples on top, spread remaining batter on top.
Bake for 1.5 hours (55 minutes in small molds), until toothpick comes out clean, rotating half way through.
Brush top with apple jelly.
Let cool for 1.5 hours, then remove from molds and let cool in fridge.

### Caramel

* 230g caster sugar
* 50g glucose syrup
* 130g heavy cream
* 200g butter
* Salt, to taste

Melt the sugar and the glucose syrup in a saucepan over medium heat until it turns a golden amber color, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
Be careful not to stir too much, as overmixing can cause crystallization.

Once the sugar has melted and reached the right color, lower the heat slightly and add the HOT cream in three additions, stirring gently after each to fully incorporate.

Let your caramel cool down to 60-80°C. If you add the butter directly when the caramel is too hot, the butter will melt instantly, disrupting the texture and making it difficult to emulsify. As a result, the caramel could split. If this happens, you can use an immersion blender to bring it back together, but it won’t be as smooth and glossy.

Add the butter and combine with an immersion blender, making sure to avoid adding air.
Add a generous pinch of salt.
The salt helps balance the sweetness of the caramel.

Cover it with plastic wrap and let it set, either at room temperature or in the fridge.


## Banana bread

Makes 12 small cakes or one big one.

* 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp cloves
* 112g room-temperate butter
* 150 gr brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 80 g plain Greek yogurt at room temperature
* 345 g mashed bananas (about 3–4 ripe bananas)
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

Heat oven to 180°C.
Whisk dries together.
Beat butter and brown sugar until light and creamy.
Add eggs one at a time.
Beat in yogurt, vanilla and mashed bananas.
Add dries to wets and combine.
Bake for 60 minutes if making one big cake; otherwise 30 minutes.


### Whipped vanilla ganache

* 200g pure white chocolate minimum 28% cocoa butter
* 350ml 35% heavy whipping cream, divided
* 1 vanilla bean or 2 tsp vanilla bean paste
* 1 tsp (5ml) pure vanilla extract

Heat 1/3 of cream until simmering and pour over chocolate to melt it.
Let stand for 1 minute, then whisk to combine.
Once cooled, add in rest of cream.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
Whip to stiff peaks for piping.
