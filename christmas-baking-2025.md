# Christmas baking 2025

We're making a Christmas trio: mandarin cake with orange blossom frosting,
banana bread with mascarpone cream (or whipped cinnamon ganache?), and
invisible cake.

## Mandarin cake

From Gartine's book.
Probably need to double the recipe to fill one cake mold.

### Cake

* 225 g carrots
* 160 ml sunflower oil
* 2 eggs
* 195 g light brown sugar
* 165 g mandarins
* 70 g almonds
* 250 g self-rising flour (find substitute)
* 1 thick vanilla stick
* 2 tsp cloves

Heat oven to 200°C.
Grease the cupcake liners with the extra tablespoon of sunflower oil and line the bottoms with baking paper.

Peel and coarsely grate the carrots.
Beat the oil, eggs, and caster sugar at high speed with a mixer until thick and creamy.
In a food processor, purée the mandarins (with their skins) with the almonds and carrots.
Add the flour, vanilla seeds, and ground cloves and mix briefly.
While still beating, gradually fold the mandarin-carrot mixture into the egg batter.
Beat until well combined, but do not overbeat.

Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners.
Bake the cupcakes in the center of the oven for 20 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the liners on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
Remove the cupcakes from their pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.

### Frosting

* 140 g room-temperature butter
* 80 g powdered sugar
* 1 tsp orange blossom water
* 100 g cream cheese
* 2 tbsp honey

Make the frosting by thoroughly beating all the ingredients together with a mixer.
Refrigerate until the cupcakes are completely cooled.
Spread the frosting on top of the cupcakes.

[Test kitchen 2](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/17178-gateau-invisible-with-brown-sugar-cinnamon-whipped-cream).

Fills a mold with 8 buns.

* 132 g granulated sugar
* 1 vanilla bean
* 2 large eggs
* 70 g all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon table salt
* 1 kg pink lady/Fuji/golden delicious, peeled
* 2 tsp apple jelly, melted

You can substitute maple syrup or honey for the apple jelly.

Whisk sugar, vanilla and eggs until smooth.
Whish in flour, baking powder, and salt until smooth.
Slice apples with mandolin; 5 slices should measure 1.2 cm (setting 3 on mandolin).
Reserve slices for the top, add all others to batter and fold to coat.
Set aside for 15 minutes.

Heat oven to 170°C.
Grease mold with vegetable spray and line with baking paper.
Fill mold with apples, lay reserved apples on top, spread remaining batter on top.
Bake for 1.5 hours, until toothpick comes out clean, rotating half way through.
Brush top with apple jelly.
Let cool for 1.5 hours, then remove from molds and let cool in fridge.

### Whipped Cream

* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2 tbsp packed dark brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon

### Caramel sauce

* 1/4 cup (60 ml) water
* 120 g sugar
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) heavy cream
* 2 tbsp (36 g) white miso

Combine water and sugar over medium heat.
Stir until syrup boils, then simmer without stirring until syrup is honey colored (5-6 minutes).
Shake and swirl as needed.
Add cream and reduce to medium-low heat.
Stir constantly, simmer until caramel is 107°C.
Off heat, whisk in miso until smooth.

## Banana bread

Maybe add cloves?

* 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 112g room-temperate butter
* 150 gr brown sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 80 g plain Greek yogurt at room temperature
* 345 g mashed bananas (about 3–4 ripe bananas)
* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

Heat oven to 180°C.
Whisk dries together.
Beat butter and brown sugar until light and creamy.
Add eggs one at a time.
Beat in yogurt, vanilla and mashed bananas.
Add dries to wets and combine.
Bake for 60 minutes.

### Ganache

* 300 g whipping cream (1) at least 33 % fat to heat
* A vanilla pod or a tbsp of vanilla extract
* 300 g whipping cream (2) at least 33 % fat kept in the fridge
* 240 g white chocolate (at least 30%) cut in small pieces

Note this is a total of 600 g cream.

Heat up the whipping cream (1) to a boil with one vanilla pod or vanilla extract. Let it infuse for 20 minutes.

Put your white chocolate in a large bowl.

Remove the vanilla pod from your whipping cream (1) and heat it up again to a boil. Pour onto your white chocolate. Let this for 1 min for the chocolate to melt.

Add the cold whipping cream and whisk until it becomes homogeneous. Let it rest in the fridge for 6 hours at least otherwise you will not be able to whip it. Whip to soft peaks before assembly of a mousse cake and to stiff peaks for piping

Not stable at room temperature. Keep in frosted cake in fridge until serving.

### Ganache alternative

Uses significantly less cream.
Maybe more stable.

* 200g pure white chocolate minimum 28% cocoa butter
* 350ml 35% heavy whipping cream, divided
* 1 vanilla bean or 2 tsp vanilla bean paste
* 1 tsp (5ml) pure vanilla extract

Heat 1/3 of cream until simmering and pour over chocolate to melt it.
Let stand for 1 minute, then whisk to combine.
Once cooled, add in rest of cream.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.
Whip to stiff peaks for piping.
