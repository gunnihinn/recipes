# Birthday cake

This is the cake I make for the kids' birthdays.
It's moist and dense, tastes good and can be layered into at least three stacks.
The recipe makes two cakes in the black cheesecake molds.

* 112 g butter at room temperature
* 330 g sugar
* 2 eggs at room temperature

* 45 g cocoa powder
* 270 g flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp baking powder

* 120 ml coffee
* 120 ml milk

Beat butter and sugar together for five minutes.
Add the eggs one at a time and let them incorporate fully.
Beat until smooth and creamy.

Whisk the drys together.
Mix the coffee and milk.

Add half of the dry mix to the eggs and sugar.
Add the coffee and milk.
Then add the rest of the dry mix.

Bake at 175°C for 25-30 minutes.

## Alternatives

### Caramel/vanilla cake

Skip the cocoa powder and add vanilla essence.
Can also substitute brown sugar for the sugar.

## Impossible cake

Use a bundt cake mold.
Butter the mold.
Melt 1/2 cup of sugar on a pan and pour it into the bottom of the mold.
Pour the cake batter into the mold.
Whisk together

* 4 eggs
* 1 can condensed milk
* 300 ml milk
* vanilla essence

and pour over the batter.

Put the cake mold into the large square glass mold and on an oven plate.
Pour boiling water into the square mold up to half the bundt mold.
Bake at 175°C for at least an hour, until a toothpick comes out dry at the top of the mold and only slightly sticky in the middle.
Let cool for an hour before attempting to flip the mold.
Cut away a flat base from the top of the cake before flipping it for stability; also removes any burnt cake from the top.
