Makes 8 small cakes or one big one.

* 132 g granulated sugar
* 1 vanilla bean
* 2 large eggs
* 70 g all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon table salt
* 1 kg pink lady/Fuji/golden delicious, peeled
* 2 tsp apple jelly, melted

I don't have apple jelly so I make a syrup from the apple peels and cores by reducing a 50/50 mix of water and sugar with them in it, then strain.

Whisk sugar, vanilla and eggs until smooth.
Whish in flour, baking powder, and salt until smooth.
Slice apples with mandolin; 5 slices should measure 1.2 cm (setting 3 on mandolin).
Reserve slices for the top, add all others to batter and fold to coat.
Set aside for 15 minutes.

Heat oven to 170°C.
Grease mold with vegetable spray and line with baking paper.
Fill mold with apples, lay reserved apples on top, spread remaining batter on top.
Bake for 1.5 hours (55 minutes in small molds), until toothpick comes out clean, rotating half way through.
Brush top with apple jelly.
Let cool for 1.5 hours, then remove from molds and let cool in fridge.

## Caramel

* 230g caster sugar
* 50g glucose syrup
* 130g heavy cream
* 200g butter
* Salt, to taste

Melt the sugar and the glucose syrup in a saucepan over medium heat until it turns a golden amber color, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
Be careful not to stir too much, as overmixing can cause crystallization.

Once the sugar has melted and reached the right color, lower the heat slightly and add the HOT cream in three additions, stirring gently after each to fully incorporate.

Let your caramel cool down to 60-80°C. If you add the butter directly when the caramel is too hot, the butter will melt instantly, disrupting the texture and making it difficult to emulsify. As a result, the caramel could split. If this happens, you can use an immersion blender to bring it back together, but it won’t be as smooth and glossy.

Add the butter and combine with an immersion blender, making sure to avoid adding air.
Add a generous pinch of salt.
The salt helps balance the sweetness of the caramel.

Cover it with plastic wrap and let it set, either at room temperature or in the fridge.
