# Brioche dough

This is the dough I usually use for rolls, from [here](https://www.crunchtimekitchen.com/savory-breakfast-rolls/).

I haven't tried making brioche from this.
For that I've usually used something from Marmiton.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cups warm water
* 3/4 tablespoon yeast, 3/4 packets
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 eggs, beaten
* 1/4 cup honey
* 170 g unsalted butter, melted
* 470 g all-purpose flour

## Instructions

Combine all ingredients except flour and mix well.
Then slowly mix in flour.
Dough will be very moist.

Cover dough loosely and let rise at room temperature for 2 hours.
Then store in fridge overnight if possible, but at least chill it for a few hours.

Bake at 190 C for as long as it takes.
