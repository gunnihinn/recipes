# Millionaire's shortbread

Make shortbread, butterscotch and ganache.
First make the shortbread and let it cool.
Then make the butterscotch, let it cool for 5 minutes, and pour it over the shortbread.
Let the two cool.
Finally make the ganache and pour it over the caramel.
Let it cool slightly and sprinkle salt flakes over the ganache.
Let everything cool overnight.

Use the red cheesecake mold mom gave you.
Once everything has set, cut out an inscribed square.
Cut a grid from that one row at a time.

Makes _a lot_ of shortbread.

## Shortbread

Preheat oven to 175°C.

* 135g flour
* 60g cornstarch
* 45g powdered sugar
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 120g melted butter

Whisk the drys together.
Use a rubber spatula or dough scraper to incorporate the butter.
Do not overwork the dough.
We want no glutein.

Scrape dough into the mold and bake for 30 minutes.

## Butterscotch

* 115g butter
* 300g brown sugar
* 235ml cream
* 2/3 tsp salt

Melt the butter in a pot on medium heat.
Warm the cream in a pot.
Whisk in the brown sugar and salt to the butter and melt it until the mix begins to bubble.
Whisk in the cream.
Bring to a boil over high heat and stir occasionally until the sauce reaches 113°C.
(If you don't have a thermometer, buy one. You can't figure this out otherwise and it matters.)
Remove from heat.

## Ganache

* 200g chocolate
* 50ml cream

Break chocolate into small pieces.
Heat up cream and mix it with the chocolate.
Use a bain mairie to finish melting the two together.
