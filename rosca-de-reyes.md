# Rosca de reyes / pan de muerto

* 500g flour
* 90g sugar
* 90g butter at room temperature
* 2 eggs
* 125 ml milk at room temperature
* pinch of salt
* 12g yeast
* 1 tsp lemon essence
* zest of 1 orange

Mix yeast into the milk and let stand for 5 minutes.

Mix everything but the butter into a hard dough.
Add the butter while mixing one spoon at a time.
Knead until glutein is very well formed.

I had better results kneading the dough by hand than in the mixer.
Be very patient when adding the butter; fully incorporate one piece into the dough before adding the next.

Put the dough into a bowl and cover with plastic.
Let rise for an hour or two at room temperature, then put it into the fridge and let rest overnight.

The next day take the dough and make a hole in the middle.
Widen the hole little by little.
Let the dough ellipse rise in the oven at 50°C for 45 minutes.

Take the dough out, heat the oven to 180°C. 
Wash with egg.
Decore the dough with pearl sugar, cherries, pasta de azucar.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Consider adding a decoration with chocolate ganache once the bread cools.

## Pasta de azucar

Make a pate brisée with 4 parts flour to 3 parts powdered sugar.
Optionally add cocoa to a part of it.

Don't make it too dry, it'll crack when rolling it out.
