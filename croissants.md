# Croissants

I'll write the recipe I made and then notes on what to change next time.

Makes 16 croissants/pain au chocolat.

* 500g flour
* 50g sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp yeast
* 56g butter at room temparature
* 360ml cold whole milk

* 340g butter

Put the dry ingredients in a mixer and mix slowly while adding the liquid in a stream.
Once mixed, turn mixer up to medium speed and let it run for 10 minutes.
While the dough is mixing, make a square of the butter.
Flatten the dough into a rectangle, put the butter square in, and fold the dough to close.
Refridgerate the dough for 30-60 minutes.

Roll out the dough and fold it into three pieces.
Turn it around and repeat.
Refridgerate the dough for an hour, then repeat, including the refridgeration.
You can let the dough rest overnight now.

If making croissants, roll out the dough and fold it in on itself on the long side, then cut out equilateral triangles with a pizza cutter.
If making pain au chocolat, roll out the dough and cut into a Nx2 pattern of squares.
Put two lines of chocolate in each square and roll it up.

Let rise and bake at 160Â°C with air for 15 minutes.
Be careful if letting rise in the oven; too warm and the butter will melt and leak.

## Next time

Put way more yeast into these.
At least 5g, maybe 10g.
The croissants fell once out of the oven.

Try making these with water instead of milk.
I don't think it adds much.

I'd like flakier croissants.
Not sure how to achieve that.
